This matlab code is an implementation of the offset filter algorithm
described in [1].  The main function is offsetFilter.m.  Type 

    help offsetFilter 

at a Matlab prompt to get a description of its usage.  There is a
short demo script (offsetFilterDemo.m) that runs the offset filter on
a few example images and displays the results, which can be run by typing

    offsetFilterDemo

at a Matlab prompt.

INSTALLATION

Add this directory to your matlab path.  Alternatively, just cd to this
directory in matlab and run the code.
